# Project Goals
The overall goal of this project will be to combine, tune and expand upon these programs to provide a tool which is interpretable for biologists. Currently RNAMigos predicts small molecule binding partners however I would like to extend this to predict proteins and functional annotations. This task will use motif fingerprints from VeRNAl and data from PDB, Rfam and GO. We will rely on interpretable prediction models at first (ie. decisions trees) to determine motif importance. The overall result will be cleaned and curated data sources; tuned parameters for VeRNAl motif extraction; trained classification models for RNA-{protein/rna/small molecule/function} prediction and novel functional insights on conserved RNA structural patterns.
